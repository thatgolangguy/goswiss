## 🤝 Contributing

**We want your knives!** 🛠️🧤  
`goswiss` is meant to be a growing collection of essential Go utilities, the kind that save you time and headaches.

If you've ever copied a helper function between Go projects, it probably belongs here.

### 🙌 How You Can Help:
- Add utility functions (e.g. `Map`, `Filter`, `RetryUntil`, `Parallel`)
- Improve test coverage and edge case handling
- Add support for more file formats (YAML, INI, TOML, etc.)
- Write clean, idiomatic docs and examples
- Suggest use cases and ergonomic APIs
- Spot bugs or design flaws — we want battle-tested code

> PRs welcome. Just keep it idiomatic, simple, and Go-like.
